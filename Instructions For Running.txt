Instructions for firing up:1) Navigate within terminal to the Keystroke Folder (the folder that was zipped).2) Run the python script “server.py” (bash: python server.py).3) Open a browser and navigate to localhost, port 8000 (localhost:8000).In the above hosting strategy we chose to create a local server on our machines that would serve the index.html file as well as the other media files to the port specified by localhost. This decision was made to simplify the addresses we would need to access, as well as ensuring all the pieces of the game were incorporated together. The game library we used suggested using a server implementation. Alternatively, our game can be played by opening the index.html file from within the Keystroke directory in a browser. This method, however, does not allow the music content and sound to come through.Alternative steps to the game without sound if complications arise from trying above:
1) Open the Keystroke directory in Finder.2) Double click “index.html” (assuming this type of file opens by default in a browser)Thank you for playing, and we hope you enjoy our game!
